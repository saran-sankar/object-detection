# object-detection
Object detection using pretrained CNN model (YOLOv2)

This is done by building on the programming assignment: https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/notebook/bbBOL/car-detection-with-yolo

The yolo.h5 file is missing from model_data. It contains the pretrained model and might be available in the Jupyter tree of the course.
